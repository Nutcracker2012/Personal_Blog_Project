# Personal Blog Project
This project is my first project for udacity front-end nano degree course. 

## Project Requirement
* This project requires meto utilize my HTML and CSS skills to build out a responsive personal blog website, including custom images, layout, and styling. Along with webpage design considerations, I worked to appropriately structure my files, as well as use proper CSS and HTML formatting & style.

### Structure
* There should be at least 3 imported files in the main CSS file, but the student is welcome to break it down even further if that makes it easier for them.
* Files are organized with a directory structure that separates files based on page and functionality.
### Design
* Start design from scratch to apply Custom images, layout, and styling.
* There is an intentional user flow on each page with appropriate links as needed.
### Layout
* Uses CSS Grid/Flexbos at least twice throughout the project to create the layout for pages
### Responsiveness
* Pages are mobile-friendly and display correctly on all display sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).
### other quality considerations
